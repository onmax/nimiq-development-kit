# NIMIQ development Kit

Start working on any of the main frontend NIMIQ projects fast.

You need to run only the first time and **every time you want to update the code**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then every time, you want to work on the wallet, simply run this command:

```bash
./wallet.sh # Open wallet in VSCode and run hub and keyguard in the background
```
